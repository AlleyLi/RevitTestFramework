RevitTestFramework
==================

The Revit Test Framework (RTF) allows you to conduct remote unit testing on Revit. RTF takes care of creating a journal file for running revit which can specify a model to start Revit, and a specific test or fixture of tests to Run. RTF's gui allows you to choose tests from a treeview and to visualize the results of the tests as they are run.
